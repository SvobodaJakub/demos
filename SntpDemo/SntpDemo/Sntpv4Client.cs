         * replaced with new instances for each sync(). That means there can be several abandoned sync()s and
         * timeoutStopwatch()es that can resolve what to do only serially, one-by-one. The use of per-class instance
         * locks for independent per-thread object locking can be a bottleneck in scenarios where high parallel
         * throughput is needed. Although it should be possible to create a correct version with proper fine-grained
         * locks, it would be unnecessarily complex, error-prone, hard to prove and unnecessary for this sntp sync
         * scenario. Moreover, the abandoned threads have only few instructions to execute before releasing
         * the lock (and dying) and thus the performance impact of a simple design is negligible in this case.
