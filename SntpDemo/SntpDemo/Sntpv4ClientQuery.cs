			//Although not required in a conforming SNTP sync implementation, it
			//is wise to consider a suite of sanity checks designed to avoid
			//various kinds of abuse that might happen as the result of server
			//implementation errors or malicious attack.  Following is a list of
			//suggested checks.

			//1.  When the IP source and destination addresses are available for
			//    the sync request, they should match the interchanged addresses
			//    in the server reply.

			//2.  When the UDP source and destination ports are available for the
			//    sync request, they should match the interchanged ports in the
			//    server reply.

			//3.  The Originate Timestamp in the server reply should match the
			//    Transmit Timestamp used in the sync request.

			//4.  The server reply should be discarded if any of the LI, Stratum,
			//    or Transmit Timestamp fields is 0 or the Mode field is not 4
			//    (unicast) or 5 (broadcast).

			//5.  A truly paranoid sync can check that the Root Delay and Root
			//    Dispersion fields are each greater than or equal to 0 and less
			//    than infinity, where infinity is currently a cozy number like one
			//    second.  This check avoids using a server whose synchronization
			//    source has expired for a very long time.

			//Completely initialize the ntp packet even though it initializes itself in the constructor
